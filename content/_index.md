# AWS App Runner Workshop

![aws app runner](/images/app-runner.png)

AWS App Runner is a new service that provides customers with a fast, simple, and secure way to
deploy applications on AWS without managing any infrastructure. Customers simply provide their
source code or container image and App Runner will automatically build and deploy the application,
load balance network traffic, automatically scale up or down based on demand, monitor health of the
application, and deliver encryption.

In this workshop, we will launch simple applications, using source code stored in GitHub, and
using containers.

### Prerequisites

This workshop will require:

- A [GitHub account](https://github.com/join) on which you can create a repository
