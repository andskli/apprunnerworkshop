# Deploy a containerized application to AWS App Runner

In this exercise, we will build a container image which we will push to
[Amazon Elastic Container Registry](https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/) (ECR), a fully managed container
registry. The container image we have built will then be deployed to AWS App Runner.
